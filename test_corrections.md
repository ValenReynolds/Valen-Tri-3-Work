# Finals-Quiz 1
A number of questions I got wrong because I read the question wrong. I also took it at 9pm and it was due at 10:30pm so I had to rush.

## Q1 
A programmer is writing a program to process large amounts of data. Which of the following considerations is LEAST likely to affect the ability of the program to process larger data sets?
* The number of lines of code, more or less code, does not effect the program processing the data set.

## Q3
A digital photo file contains data representing the level of red, green, and blue for each pixel in the photo. The file also contains metadata that describes the date and geographic location where the photo was taken. 
For which of the following goals would analyzing the metadata be more appropriate than analyzing the data?
* Determine the number of people in the photo is not possible with the metadata. I can determine the date and location which I can check against a public event date and time.

## Q10
Which of the following is the most likely data privacy concern of the upgraded system?
* New solution added a database with customer information. This could be exposed to hackers. 
* I thought a "malicious link" means SQL injection that would allow a hacker to gain access to a database.

## Q11
The upgraded system uses a directory containing additional information not supplied by the customer. The directory is used to help direct calls effectively. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be included in the directory?
* A list of company computers and PI addresses would not be helpful in the upgraded directory. I confused the old system and new system.

## Q12 
To direct a call to the appropriate destination, which of the following input data is needed by the upgraded system that was NOT needed by the original system?

i. Audio signal of the customer’s voice
ii. The customer’s keypad selection
iii. The customer’s phone number

* I thought the phone number would be helpful in the new system to look up information from people who called previously. 
* THe customer voice is all that is needed in the new system if we ignore remembering any customer past calls.

## Q16
Which of the following CANNOT be determined using only the information in the database?

* Movies purchased by a subscriber this month won't work because we do nt know who the subscribers are.
* All these questions confused me and I kept picking things that did work not things that do not work.

## Q18
Which of the following is a characteristic of the fault-tolerant nature of routing on the Internet?
* Answer seems obvious now. Able to send your transmission where it needs to go if some network routes fail in between. 
* I thought DNS names allowed routing to work so that enabled fault tolernace to be implemented.

## Q26
For which of the following goals would it be more useful to analyze the data instead of the metadata?
* Since the time of day of each post is in the data I thought we can learn about activity with lots and lots of posts, like Reddit. That was the metadata not the data.
* The data can be searched to figure out what the topic is, I guess, so B would be a use for the data in posts.

## Q29
In order to test the program, the programmer initializes numList to [0, 1, 4, 5]. The program displays 10, and the programmer concludes that the program works as intended.
Which of the following is true?
* I knew it was incorrect because the first value of 0 was initializing sum, then sum added it again. 
* I thought the list needed to start with the 2nd number in increasing order to work right. It does not have to be in order to work right.

## Q32
Which of the following changes can be made so that the procedure will work as intended?
* I guessed wrong I was running out of time. I see item C is right.

## Q37
Which of the following initial values for x, y, and z can be used to show that the code segment does not work as intended?
* Rushing again. I didn't have time to work them all through carefully. I figured it had to be C or D.

## Q47
Which of the following statements are true about the ability for devices A and C to communicate?
Select two answers.
* I just selected the first right answer. 
* I did not see it said select two on the second line because I am going too fast and I need to re-read the questions slowly.

## Q50
Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image. A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. 
Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?
* I forgot what lossless means. I thought it could lose a little bit. The right answer is hard to understand and I don't know how lossless is done.
