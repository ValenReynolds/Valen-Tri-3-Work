# Test Corrections-Quiz 3

* Question 1: It's pretty obvious you have to take away V and P. But I misclicked and put one.
* Question 2: I picked C which is wrong because there are problems that can’t be solved and I didn’t know that. I thought problems with more data were just harder to process. 
* Question 4: I chose B by accident its pretty obvious computers can communicate directly because internet communication uses standard protocols. 
* Question 8: I chose A because I thought that to get a pair you need to split the procedure into two parts which is not true. 
* Question 13: I thought you just multiply by 5 then 7. 
* Question 17: I knew it was C and D because the numbers have to be higher than the second two so A does not make sense.
