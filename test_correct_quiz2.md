# Test Corrections-Quiz 2
Question 5 
I chose D because I thought citizen meant they included a wide variety of students but in fact they don't. Its A because that is a practical project that requires plants from around the world.

Question 8
I chose C because I weighed the other options and was torn between A and C. I know open source is a decision by developers so I thought it would be true.

Question 26
I chose A on accident it is obviously C because having people from diverse backgrounds doesn't mean you don't test it means you can avoid bias.

Question 45
C is incorrect because you can't determine the students with less then a 3.5 GPA I didn't notice. A is correct because you can use the ID's to identify the students who play sports then you can see the GPA.

Question 47
I didn't really understand the graph but when students now I understand the circles meant applications and therefore students who read more are more likley to say they are intrested in an application.
